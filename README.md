# Automated Data Cleaning Project 
## Overview
Welcome to the Automated Data Cleaning project! This project is designed to automate the cleaning process of a household income dataset using SQL. The main goal is to enhance data quality by eliminating duplicates, standardizing information, and ensuring consistent and accurate data.

## Features
### Stored Procedure: The project includes a comprehensive stored procedure that is responsible for copying and cleaning the dataset. This stored procedure is crafted to handle various data cleaning tasks, ensuring a robust and efficient data cleaning process.

### Duplicate Elimination: The stored procedure is equipped to identify and eliminate duplicate entries within the dataset. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data and preventing redundancy.

### Data Standardization: The project addresses data inconsistency issues by standardizing information. This includes formatting data to a consistent structure, making it easier to analyze and work with.

### Event Scheduler: An event scheduler is implemented to automate the execution of the data cleaning procedure at regular intervals. This ensures ongoing maintenance of the dataset, keeping it up-to-date and reliable.

## How to Use
Follow these steps to utilize the Automated Data Cleaning project:

## Database Setup:

Ensure that you have a compatible SQL database set up.
Execute the necessary scripts to create the required tables and structures.

### Stored Procedure:
Review and understand the provided stored procedure.
Customize the stored procedure based on your specific dataset and cleaning requirements.

### Event Scheduler:
Configure the event scheduler to run the data cleaning procedure at your desired intervals.
Adjust the schedule based on the frequency of updates to your dataset.

### Monitoring and Logs:
Implement logging mechanisms within the stored procedure to track the cleaning process.
Regularly monitor logs to ensure the cleaning process is running smoothly and effectively.

## Dependencies
SQL database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Appropriate user privileges to execute stored procedures and manage event schedulers.
